    "synopsis": "Synopsis: Dean Pereira and Cindy Heller Pereira are a young, working class married couple &#8211; Dean currently working as a painter, and Cindy working as a nurse in a medical clinic &#8211; with a young daughter named Frankie. Despite their relatively tender ages, they are both ravaged by the life they&#8217;ve eked out together and by the experiences they&#8217;ve had leading into their marriage. Dean, a high school drop out, comes from a broken home, where he never really had a mother figure. He never saw himself getting married or having a family despite falling in love at first sight with Cindy. He doesn&#8217;t have any professional ambition beyond his current work &#8211; which he enjoys since he feels he can knock off a beer at 8 o&#8217;clock in the morning without it affecting his work &#8211; although Cindy believes he has so much more potential in life. Cindy also comes from a dysfunctional family, with her own mother and father not setting an example of a harmonious married or family life. One of her previous serious relationships was with Bobby Ontario, that relationship which has a profound affect on many aspects of her marriage to Dean. Dean and Cindy head off on an overnight getaway together without Frankie, the getaway which may provide a clearer picture if their marriage can survive its many issues.",
